# App-Mod-Booster
A project to show how GitHub coding agent can turn screenshots of a legacy app into a working proof-of-concept for a cloud native Azure replacement if the legacy database schema is also provided.

Steps to modernise an app:

1. Fork this repo 
2. In new repo replace the screenshots and sql schema (or keep the samples)
3. Open the coding agent and use app-mod-booster agent telling it "modernise my app"
4. When the app code is generated (can take up to 30 minutes) there will be a pull request to approve.
5. Now you can use codespaces to deploy the app to azure (or open VS Code and clone the repo locally - you will need to install some tools locally or use the devcontainer)
6. Open terminal and type "az login" to set subscription/context
7. Then type "bash deploy.sh" to deploy the app and db or "bash deploy-with-chat.sh" to deploy the app, db and chat UI.
