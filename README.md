# App-Mod-Assist
A project to show how GitHub coding agent can turn screenshots of legacy apps into working proof-of-concepts for cloud native Azure replacements if the legacy database schema is also provided

WARNING: COLLABORATORS MUST FORK THE REPO AGAIN EVERY TIME THEY RUN THE CODING AGENT TO TEST IT TO NOT POLLUTE THIS BASE TEMPLATE (< DELETE WHEN HAVE WAY OF WORKING)

(REAL INSTRUCTIONS >) Fork this repo then open the coding agent and use app-mod-assist agent telling it "modernise my app" - making sure to replace the screenshots and sql schema first
